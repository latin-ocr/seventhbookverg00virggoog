PREFACE. V

would have them do, without break to the end. This I
have done tor reasons that have already been indicated
-as a means of repeating and summing up points touch-
ing the meaning and mode oi rendering, and also as the
best way to throw into darker relies faults of translation
that are most incorrigible and deplorable, ifhaply Ι may
make some a little unhappy over their own too literal, bald,
and anti-poetical versions.

In this practise I have found the seventh book of the
Aeneid much the most difficult of the whole poem, and
that first suggested to me the desirableness of wrlting out
atranslation for my own use; further reflection led me
to think that by publishing it I might do a service to
students and teachers oi Vergil.

It will not require many words to explain the principles
on which this translation has been made. lt was not at
all my aim to make what is generally understood bya
“literal'' translation, i. e. a translation in which the syn·
tactical structure of the original is, so far as possible,
scrupulously and rigorously reflected. Whatever raison
d’dtre such translations may have, the use of them by
boys and girls is sure to foster laziness and weaken self-
reliance. Still less had l any purpose of making what is
called a “free ’' translation, interpolating or suppressing,
expanding or retrenehing, at my own pleasure or con·
venienee. I have sought everywhere and always to
express the exact meaning of the original as rigorously
as would be done in the most literal version, without
addition for. the sake of ornament, or omission or
obscurity for the sake of evading a difficulty. But t

have tried to do this without oilence to the pumex o&
English idiom. ‚
