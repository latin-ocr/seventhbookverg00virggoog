vi PREFACE.

In the next place I have made it aconstant study to
keep as close to the Latin order as possible, still under
' the imperative condition that in no case should English
order be strained or transgressed3 and I have sometimes
been surprised to see how far the order of the original
could be imitated in a translation. Ι have tried to
impart to my version a slight poetical flavor, but without

have alre'ady stated and which Ι deemed of paramount
importance. The splendid achievement of Professor

no more forme than prompt me to try to imitate him ; it

Ihave said that I found this seventh book the most
difficolt one of the whole Aeneid. Ι do not mean diffi-
