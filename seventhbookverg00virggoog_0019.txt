Lee many more3 but from none of these do I remember
appropriating an entire sentence. But whoever makes a
detailed comparison of my version with Conington's prose
translation, will see that my obligations to him are by no .
“ means small. Of course a great many verbal coin-
cidences are accidental. Iwould gladly have acknowl-

edged all explicit appropriations andradaptations but
such a course, besides being impracticable, would convey ’
an errone0u5‚ because inadequate, impression. How can
one indicate the many subtle suggestions that spring from
a minute and prolonged comparison and balaneing of
one’s own forms of expression with the text of the
original and with another's renderings?

On the other hand I ought not to exaggerate my in-
debtedness to Conington. His prose translation of the
seventh book oi the Aeneid ends with line 640, thus
covering onlya little more than three fourths oi the book.
Iam not able to see that my translation oi this omitted
fourth falls below the other parts in which I had the aid
oi Conington.

I now commit my completed tasl( to the searching
criticism and judgment of my fellow-teachers. If it does
not prove useiul in the way I intended, it may prove not
without helpiul suggestiveness
