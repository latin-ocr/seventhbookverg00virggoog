given does not indicate the construction oi the original,
and also in reference to the study of words; partly ina
criticism oi the translati0n; that is, in such inquiries as,
“ Why was this torm of expression choseh?'’ “Why this
order?’' “Why was <the construction of the Latin not·
followed here ? '' “ How would the rhythmical character of
this sentence be affected by the substitution oi this or
that word? ’' “How is the force oi this Latin suffix con·
veyed?'’ “Does the Latin contain all that is expressed
in the translation ? '² “Is anything in the Latin lost in the
translation?'’ Such an examination will surely sharpen
the insight and appreciation, improve the taste‚ and
beget a wholesome dislike of crude and slovenly versions

Drill in syntax should be allowed to sleep ior ¹a
time and many points be permitted to pass unnoticed
that might easily invite discussion. A class should be
able to take double the ordinary lesson, and when the
book has been completed in this way, it should be rapidly
reviewed without the accompanying translation, and the
only work required should be the metrical reading oi the

text and an independent version by the student. Inde-
pendent, but not too insistently independent, since not a

little of the translation studied will remain in the memory.
It is not oi course to be expected or required of the pupil
that he shall translate into rhythmical prose ; but it is to
be hoped that much reading aloud of the translation sup
plied will cultivate the ear and insensibly give a feeling
tor cadence that will affect the choice ot words and forms
of expression.
