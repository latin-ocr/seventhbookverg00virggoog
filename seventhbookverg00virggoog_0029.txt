gather some native muts, which they heap up on broad
wheaten cakes and refresh themselves with this food under
the hospitable shade of a lofty tree. After eating the fruits,
they are about to break and eat the wheaten cakes also, when
Iulus exclaims: ‘⁴ Why, we are eating our tables!'’ V This
is at once recognized as the harmiess fulfillment of the dread
prophecy of Celaen03 and for the first time the weary Trojans
rejoice in the assurance that their wanderings are at an end.
They have reached the promised Hesperia.

At the time of Aeneas's arrival, Latinus is king in Latium.
His daughter Lavinia is betrothed to Turnus, king of the
Rutuli, a suitor favored by the queen Amata. But Latinus
hasa misgiving, for the oracle of Faunus, his prophetie sire,
has declared that Lavinia is to wed a foreigner and become the
mother of a posterity that shall rule the world. Accordingly,
when Aeneas sends an embassy with overtures of friendship‚
Latinus graciously receives the envoys and cordially accepts
the proffered alliance.

At this point, Juno again interposes to wreck the fortunes of
the hated Trojans. She sends Alecto, one of the FurieS, who
incites Amata to stir up the matrons of Latium, and afterwards
goads Turnus to vengeance. Iulus, τοο, while hunting, kills a
favorite stag, and thereby rouses Tyrrhus, keeper of the royal
herds, to fury. At instigation of Tyrrhus, the peasantry take
up arms. A conflict is precipitated in which two shepherds
are slain hy the Trojans. The whole country is instantly in
arms, and Latinus is urged on* every hand to declare war
against the strangers. Remonstrance is unavailing, and the
aged king shuts himself up in his palace and lays down the
reins of government.

The book closes with a long account of the mustering of the
Italian tribes for war against the Trojans.
