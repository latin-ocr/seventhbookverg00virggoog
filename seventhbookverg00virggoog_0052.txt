THE AENEID, Vll. 23

with his message the followers of Aeneas return
mounted and with high hearts bringing back a mes· 285
sage of peace.

But lo! returning from Inachian Argos there was
the cruel wife of Jove, even now holding on her way

lightly through the air. From the distant sky, even
from above Sicilian Pachynus she discerns glad-

keen anguish she paused‚ then shaking her head,
poured forth these words from her breast: “Ah‚
hated tace! ah, fates opposed to mine-tates of the

have been spent against the Trojans. What have the
Syrtes or Scylla, what has yawning Charybdis done

from me. Mars had power to destroy the giant race
of the Lapithae. The father of the gods himself
gave up ancient Calydon to the vengeance of Diana.
For what crime deserved the Lapithae or Calydon
such vengeance? But l, Jove’s great consort, who
have stooped without success to dare all, who have
turned to every shift, am overcome by Aeneas! But
if, goddess as Ι am, I have not might enough, let me 310
not shrink from calling to my aid whatever power
