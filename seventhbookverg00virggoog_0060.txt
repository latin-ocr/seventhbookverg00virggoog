THE AENElD, Vll. 31

eries clad in skins, and bearing vinewreathed .
spears. In their midst Amata herself all glowing
holds aloft a burning pine-torch, chanting the bridal
song of Turnus and her daughter, rolling blood-shot
eyeS, and of a sudden eries with savage voice: “ Ho,
mothers of Latium, hear me all, where'er ye be, if 400
any love in kind hearts remains for poor Amata. If
haunting care for a mother's rights stirs your soulS,
loose the fillets of your hair, take up with me the
rites 01 Bacchus.'' So frenzied does Alecto drive

the queen this way and that among the woods‚ ’
among the lonely haunts of wild beasts with goads 405
of Bacchus.

’ When the Fury deemed she had whetted enough

the queen’s frrst frenzies and had overturned the
plan and all the house 01 Latinus, forthwith the aw-

ful goddess rising on dusky wings, speeds thence to

the walls of the bold Rutulian, to the city founded,

it is said, by Danae for Argiue settlers‚ borne hither 410
from her course by the swift south wind. The place

was once called Ardea by men 01 old3 even now it
keeps the great name Ardea, but its prosperity is no
more. Here, Turnus, in his high-roofed palace,
was now plucking deep repose from the dark night.
Alecto puts off her hideous looks and form 01 a 415
fury; she transforms herself to an old woman in
features and furrows her ugly brow with wrinkles;

she puts on white hair together with a fillet, and
twines it round with spray 01 011νο; she becomes
Calybe, the aged priestess of Juno’s temple, and
before the eyes of the young warrior presents her-

self with these words: “ Turnus, wilt thou let so 4²0
many toils be spent in vain and thy sceptre be
transferred to Dardan settlers? The king refuses
thee thy bride and the dowry earned with thy blood„

and an heir from afar is sought for the throne„ Qn
