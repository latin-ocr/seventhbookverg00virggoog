first cause 01 woes, kindling the hearts of rustics to
war.

There was a stag 01 surpassing beauty, with tower-
ing horns, which the sons 01 Tyrrhus had snatched
from its dam and used to· tend, they and their
father Tyrrhus, who kept the royal herds, and had 485
all the wide plain committed to his charge. The
wild creature, trained to obey, Silvia, their sister,
used to deck with all care, twining its antlers with
soft festoons ; to comb it, too, and wash it in a clear
stream. The stag, patient 01 the hand and accus· 490
10111011 to the table 01 its master,·would graze at large
in the woods and return home 01 itself, to the well-
known door, however late at night. As once it was
wandering far, the maddened hounds 01 the hunts-
man Iulus started it, while it chanced, now to be
floating down a stream, now cooling its heat on the 495
green bank. Also Ascanius himself, burning with
desire 101 uncommon praise, bent his bow and
aimed his shaft, nor was a god's presence wanting
to his erring hand; with a loud whiz the reed
flies, driven through belly and through flank. But
the wounded creature fied to its familiar shelter, 500
reached its told monning, and covered with blood
and like one pleading, filled the whole house with
its wail.

The sister Silvia is the first to call 101 help, smiting
her arms with open hands, and gathers the hardy
rustics by her eries They, 101 the 1011 1101111 lurks 505
in the silent woods, are speedily at hand, armed, this
one with a stake burned at the end, this one with
heavy knotted club ; whatever each one finds, as he

ι searches round, wrath makes his weapon. Tyrrhus, as

·-· by chance he was cleaving in four a log 01 oak, driv-

ῑ ing home the wedgeS, calls his bands to the ‘nav and
