THE AENEID, VII. 27

in sunder the bonds of peace, sow seeds of war; let
the warrior youth at the same moment desire,
demand, and snatch up arms’' 340
At once Alecto, steeped in Gorgon poison, turns
first to Latium and the lofty palace of the Lauren-
tine king, and crouches at the¹ silent threshold of
Amata, whom all a woman's cares and spite about
the coming of the Trojans and the marriage with
Turnus was heating to a glow. At her the god· 345

its poisonous breath. The hideous snake becomes a
golden necklace, becomes the festoon of her long
fillet; it twines in and out her hair and winds its
smooth way over her limbs And while the infec-
tion, penetrating with moist venom, begins to steal
over her senses and thrills her bones with tire, ere 355
yet her spirit has quite felt the flame through her
whole bosom, she speaks more gently, and as
, mothers are wont‚ shedding many tears about her
daughter and the Phrygian marriage. “To exiles
from Troy shall Lavinia be given in wedlock‚ father?
Have you no pity for your daughter and yourself? 360

wind that pirate will leave, all faithless, and make for
the deep with his stolen bride? But was it not
even so that the Phrygian shepherd won his way to
Lacedaemon, and bore off Helen, daughter of Leda,
to Trojan cities? What of your solemn pledge?
What of your care of old for your own? And that 365
right hand given so many times to your hinsman
Turnus? lia son-in-law must be sought ior *ene
