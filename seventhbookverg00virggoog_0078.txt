c'rowned chariot and his victorious steeds, comes the
seed of handsome HerculeS, handsome AventinuS,
and on his shield he bears the emblem of his father,

the Hydra, girt with a hundred snakes. Him ina
grove of the ,Aventine hill, the priestess Rhea bore

in secret and brought forth to the realms of light, a 660
woman uniting with a god, after the hero of TirynS,
slayer of Geryon, came as victor to the fields ol
Laurentumv and bathed his Iberian cows in the
Tuscan stream. Javelins in their hands and cruel
pikes his men bear to the war, and fight with tapering
sword and Sabellian spear. He himself on loot, 665

shoulders robed like those of Hercules

loud crash.

come, born to Vulcan mid flocks of the field, a
prince, and found at the hearth‚ so every age hath 680
believed, Caeculus his name. Him attends a band of
peasants loosely orderedl, the men who dwell in high
Praeneste and the lands of Gabii, sacred to Juno,
and by cold Anio's bankS, and on the Hernic cliffS,
bedewed by streams. These thou dost seed, rich

Ι Anagnia, and thy stream, t00, father Amasenus 685
