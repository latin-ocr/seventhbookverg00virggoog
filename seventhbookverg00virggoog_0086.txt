Styx. But kind Trivia hides Hippolytus in her own

lraunts and commits him to the nymph Egeria and 775

lrer grove, that there alone, in Italian woodS, unknown

to fame he may pass his lile and with changed name

'be Virbius.1 Whence still from Trivia's temple and
‘the sacred grove horn-hooled horses are kept away;
because, scared by monsters from the sea, they
dashed to ruin c‘hariot and hero on the shore. Yet 780
none the less guided the son his frery steeds along
the level oi the plain and in his chariot rushed to
war.

Turnus himself, of beauteous form moves with
arms in hand among the foremost and overtops
them by a whole head. His towering helmet with
three-sold erest of hair bears a Chimaera breathing 785
forth fires oi Aetna from her jaws, raging and wild
with baleiul flames so much the more, the more
fiercely waxes the cnsanguined fight. But his smooth
shield bore for emblem an Io with uplifted horns
in gold, now a heiler, clothed with hair, a wondrous 790
device3 and Argus, watcher oi the maid, and father
Inachus pouring out a river from a chased urn. Him
follows a cloud of marching men, and hosts armed
with shields crowd all the plains‚ Argive braveS‚
Aruncan bands‚ Rutuli and Sicanians of ancient 795
stock, Sacranian ranks and Labici with painted
shields: they who plough thy glades, Tiber‚ and the
sacred shore oi Numicius, and vex with the share the
Rutulian hills and Circe’s height3 and the land over
which Jupiter Anxurus watches‚ and Feronia delight-
ing in her green grove, where lies the gloomy lake 800

of Satura, and where the cold Ufens seeks away
through the lowest vales and buries itseli in the

sea.

Ire was Vir bis!
