THE AENEID, v11. 59
seesides these comes Camilla of the Volscian tace,
leading a band of knights and squadrons gleaming
in bronze, a warrior maid, her woman's hands not
wonted to the distaff and basket of Minerva, but, 805
maid as she wan, used to endure stern combats and to
outstrip the winds by speed of foot. She could skim
along the top of a field of grain untouched hythe
sickle, and leave the tender ears uncrushed by her
tread 3 or, over mid-sea poised on the swelling-waves‚ 810
she could speed on her way, nor dip in the sea her
fiying feet. Her, all the youth, pouring out from
home and fields, and throngs of women see with
wonder, and follow with their eyes as she goeS, open-
mouthed‚ with souls owe-struck to see how the pride
of royal purple veils her smooth shoulders3 how a 815
olasp ol gold confines her hair, how she hears a
Lycian quiver and shepherd'ps pike of myrtle-wood,
‚r'pped with point of iron.
