OW that the Beginner’s Latin Book has been before the public
nearly six years, the publishers are able to say without hesita-
tion that it has been far more successful than any other introduc-
tory Latin book ever published in this country. This‘ remarkable
result 10 ducto 0 0001110011οο 01 excellences so skilfully blended
that 0110010 010 10010 p'atent than causes. While the book may be
used 00 00 introduction to Caesar, it 10 10010 than this-it 10 00
introduction 10 Latin as a language. It prepares the student 1101
only 10 begin the study of Caesar, but, with proper guidance, to
make remarkably ropid and satisfactory propress in reading and
understanding 110110.4 The skill 01 the authors ae teachers has
enabled 1110111 to secure these larger results without deviation 11001
the main line or increase 01 (1111100111οε. The fundamental idea was
10 combine the utmost practice with the minimum 01 theory, on
the principle that a thorough acquisition 01 the elementa 01 Latin
by the young 1001001 must be 10010 0 process than a scienee, more ,

chanical following 0110100 011110 01010100 01 analysis and conscious >
inductive reasoning. There are therefore abundant and varied
exercisee on the forms and more important constructione of 111οξ
language. The shilful choica of words 1100 made it possible to·
provide exercises that are in themselves interesting. The colloquio:
(simple Latin dialogum), the extracta 101 translation, 101101100οᾱΙ
as early as possible, and the mode 01 treatment throughout 0101
made to impert attractiveness‚ treshness, and variety, though ther&
is no sacrifice 01 rigorous 0010011110 method. Even if the 11010
allowed 101 Latin the first year is quite limited‚ teachers may still
be able to carry classes through the book by omitting certain de·
